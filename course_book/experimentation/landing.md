# Experimentation

This section will distill the basics of experimentation into three sections: 

* [Conceptualization](https://avakiai.com/expra_winter2021-2022/experimentation/conceptualization.html)
* [Execution](https://avakiai.com/expra_winter2021-2022/experimentation/execution.html)
* [Finalization](https://avakiai.com/expra_winter2021-2022/experimentation/finalization.html)

This is roughly the same structure as the three modules that make up our [semester](https://avakiai.com/expra_winter2021-2022/syllabus.html).

In the **Conceptualization** section, we'll go over the components you need to begin thinking about and developing an actionable project. 

In the **Execution** section, we'll go over the steps of implementing and executing an experiment. 

Finally, in the **Finalization** section, we'll talk about how to finalize analysis, polish up figures, forge a manuscript, practice presenting
your results, and wrap up a project. 

All along, we'll use tools that will allow our work to be replicable and tranparent. Don't worry if some of these seem opaque to you now, you
can always come back to them at a later time. There's also almost always a simplified way of interacting with these tools (such as Git repositories), 
that we'll emphasize in class. 

Let's get started!
