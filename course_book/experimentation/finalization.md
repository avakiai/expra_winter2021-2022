# Finalization

`Module III`

In the final stage of a study, we'll generate our results by systematically stepping through our analysis plan, focus on polishing our figures to be maximally effective, revisit our hypothesis and infer some conclusions from our results, and get our study into a form ready for others to consume (whether as a poster, presentation, or written document). We'll also wrap up our study by linking our `analysis` repository and `Pavlovia` repository to our OSF project, and posting a version of our report and/or poster to the same.

### Analysis

We'll divide up our analyses into four parts, which we'll tackle and finalize in the few weeks of `Module III`.

#### Week 10: Analysis I

Aim: Analysis of Liking (Likert scale) Rating. 

* Ordinal Logistic Regression
* Answer `Hypothesis 3`: Did WM load and explicit information affect liking (rating scores)? 

Materials: [Script](https://github.com/avakiai/expra_repeated_recording_illusion/blob/master/analysis/RRI_Analysis_I.Rmd)

Deadlines for this week (by end of week): 

1. Complete liking ratings analysis
2. Begin classification of participants

#### Week 11: Analysis II

Aim: Classification of participants according to whether they fell for the illusion or not. 

* Analysis of open-text responses. 
* Preparation to answering `Hypothesis 1`: Did WM load, explicit information manipulate rates at which people fell for the illusion?

Materials: [Script](https://github.com/avakiai/expra_repeated_recording_illusion/blob/master/analysis/RRI_Analysis_II.Rmd)

Deadlines for this week (by start of class): 

1. Continue classification of participants
2. Begin programming chi-square analysis & demographic analyses

#### Week 12: Analysis III

Aim: Analysis of rate of falling for the illusion

* Chi-square Analysis of frequency of falling for illusion under different conditions
* Answer `Hypothesis 1`: Did WM load, explicit information manipulate rates at which people fell for the illusion?

Materials: [Script](https://github.com/avakiai/expra_repeated_recording_illusion/blob/master/analysis/RRI_Analysis_III.Rmd)

Deadlines for this week (by start of class): 

1. Complete classification of participants
2. Complete chi-square analysis

#### Week 13: Analysis IV

Aim: Explore secondary analyses regarding role of sex, age, musical experience. 

* Summarise demographic breakdown.
* Examine GSI ratings. (Optional: Examine rate of falling for the illusion given musical expertise.)

Materials: [Script](https://github.com/avakiai/expra_repeated_recording_illusion/blob/master/analysis/RRI_Analysis_IV.Rmd)

Deadlines for this week (by start of class): 

1. Any final questions about analyses.
