# Repeated Presentation Experiment

## Literature
A couple references to get you started can be found [here](https://avakiai.github.io/expra_winter2021-2022/projects/repeated_presentation/literature). 

## Stimuli

* What genres would you like to test?

* What pieces of music?

## Methods

* How might order effects, memory, framing, priming affect the judgments you'd like to measure? Do some literature research and jot down some ideas to talk about with your pod. 

* What types of framings/manipulations would you like to use? Prestige is only one option. Think about how you might want to structure levels of the framing manipulation. 

* Think about whether you'd like to tease apart noise from bias. [This article](* Think about whether you'd like to tease apart
) might be a good place to start. 

* What sort of design (between- or within-subjects) might help you best answer your question, given your answers to the above?
