# Syllabus

Within the EXPRA, we will talk about and work through the core aspects of a scientific project, i.e. the `research workflow`, covering everything from `preparing a project and generating hypotheses` over `data acquisition and documentation` to `data analyzes and results communication`. These three defining parts will also be used as cornerstones of the course outline and will entail respective more-detailed subsections. The graphic below provides the respective outline.
