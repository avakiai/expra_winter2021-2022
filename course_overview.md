# Course overview
  
### Hi! I'm your instructor!

The contact information of the instructor are as follows:

### Overview

This course will be held weekly, and includes a mix of traditional lectures, interactive demonstrations, tutorials, journal clubs, discussion, and project Workshop (“workshop”). Outside of class, you will be expected to meet with your pods (project groups) to implement your experiment, collect data, and complete your analysis and summary reports. 

As the term goes on, we will spend less time on lectures and more time addressing particular questions/issues/tasks you have to deal with in carrying out and analyzing your results. We may choose not to meet in person on some weeks, or to meet only for part of class time. Depending on common preference, groups can arrange to meet with me separately to discuss particular issues, instead of meeting for the whole Projects Workshop slot. Therefore, the schedule for weeks to come is to be taken merely as a guideline unless otherwise stated.

#### When

Every Thursday from Oct. 21, 2021 until February 10th, 2022 at 14:00 - 18:00.

Please note that semester from December 18th, 2021 - January 13th, 2022 and no classes will take place within this time period.

#### COVID

**Class**: The university has announced that teaching this term should be done in person under the 3G Rules. This means that in order to attend class, you must show proof of vaccination, recovery from COVID (only once), or a negative antigen test (for each class). Please get in touch with me if you have any questions or concerns about this. 
We may choose to hold some classes on Zoom throughout the semester, however the format will be largely in-person unless COVID regulations change. 

**Projects**: Experiments with human participants will be done online, while experiments with animal participants will be done in person, unless otherwise noted. 

**Deadlines**: Until we/your hear otherwise, the deadlines are the deadlines. :)


#### Hardware & Software

In this class, we will rely heavily on software designed for statistics and data science, such as R and some Python. We will use only open source and free software. To get you set up for this course, check out this [comprehensive installation instruction]() from a fellow EXPRA instructor, Peer Herholz. In a step-by-step manner it will guide you through the installation process, covering several `OS`: `windows`, `macos` and `linux`. 


#### Syllabus and Text

As noted above, this page serves as the syllabus for this course, with the precise outline indicated in the [respective section](https://peerherholz.github.io/EXPRA_Winter2021/outline.html). This syllabus is subject to change; students who miss class are responsible for learning about any changes to the syllabus.

The course has several textbooks, all of which are online and free:

Additional reading material might be added but will always be open & free with students being informed about any addition.



#### How to get those credits?

As this is a practical lab course intended to provide you with an introduction to the workflow and life cycle of scientific research projects via a mixture of guided and  independent work, your assignments and tasks will be rather diverse and quite different from other modules. This is by all means intended and founded on the idea that this course should entail a holistic overview of the research process beyond the classic "do this, do that, n=30, do a t-test, tell a story, publish or perish" nonsense. Instead, the goal is to enable you to critically perceive and evaluated research, its implementation and its outcomes, regarding both your own work and that of others. The assignments and tasks aim to reflect these aspects and will entail working on research projects, evaluating that of others, reading project-related and general research-related literature and more. The different parts and grading scheme are further outlined below. 

##### Exams and Assignments

In general, there will be two classes of assignments and tasks you need to work on in order to (successfully) pass this course: ungraded assessments and graded exams. The first will take place throughout the semester at various time points whereas the latter will entail two written research reports, one mid-term at roughly half of the semester and one final three weeks after the last session. 

The ungraded assessments focus on different parts of the research workflow and your active engagement with them:

- reading articles/materials for your project/that are assigned for class (individually or in groups)
- present a research article (journal club) related to your project (individually)
- conduct reviews of another group's project and provide feedback (in groups) 
- prepare a scientific poster showcasing the results of your experiment (in groups) 

The graded exams aim to assess your ability to bring the different parts of the research workflow together:

- write a research report on the demo experiment (in groups)
- write a 15-page research report in the style of a scientific paper summarizing your experiment (individually) 

##### Grading

Your final course grade will be determined by all these aspects, however with a different weight. As mentioned above, the graded exams will entail two written research reports. They will have the biggest weight in the calculation of your grade, both 40%. The ungraded assessments will be, you guessed right, ungraded but nonetheless influencing your final grade. How and why you asked? First, the assessments will be used to evaluate your work throughout the course and knowledge/experience you gained. Therefore, they will inform the scoring of your graded exams. Second, the research process is not static but continuous and so are your experience and skills. Thus, why would it be fair to assign your work a grade on a rather static outcome? All your efforts should be considered. Additionally, research is by no means a one-person thing (even though modern day science/academia looks/acts this way): it's about folks from different backgrounds coming together to work openly and collaboratively to create, preserve and disseminate knowledge. The way we act and the environment we create are crucial and will thus be evaluated as well.

| Assignment/task | percentage of final grade  | deadline (dd/mm/yyyy, time) |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| assessments | 20% | ongoing basis throughout the semester |
| demo experiment report | 40% | 08/12/2021, 11:59 PM CET |
| research experiment report | 40% | 23/02/2022, 11:59 PM CET |

##### Academic Honor Code

You are encouraged to discuss problem sets with classmates and work on them together, but certain written submissions must reflect your own, original work. If you worked with other students on a problem set, please include their names in a statement like "I worked on this homework with XX and YY" on the assignment. If in doubt, ask the instructor.

##### Notice about missed work due to religious holy days

Please notify the instructor of your pending absence at least fourteen days prior to the date of observance of a religious holy day. If you must miss a class, an examination, a work assignment, or a project in order to observe a religious holy day, I will give you an opportunity to complete the missed work within a reasonable time after the absence.
