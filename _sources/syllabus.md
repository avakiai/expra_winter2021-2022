# Syllabus

This class will be organized into three general modules: 

In `Module I`, we will cover the basis of psychological experimentation, how to build models and develop hypotheses, how to make a project as "open" as possible, and writing well and reading efficiently. We will analyze the data from a "demonstration experiment" together, which you will write up into your Demo Reports. Finally, we'll introduce the project topics for this semester and you will split intro groups ("pods") to begin the conceptualization phase of the term project. 

In `Module II`, the intense portion of project development begins. Here the aims are to (a) formalize models/hypotheses/predictions and write up a preregistration, (b) implement the experiment online/in the lab, (c) collect data, and (d) begin data analysis. 

In `Module III`, after the winter break, you will go deeper into data analysis with statistical modelling and data visualization, and finally the discussion and finalization of the project. We'll have a poster session where each pod will present their results (one poster per pod), and you will submit your final reports (one per person) 3 weeks after the last Project Workshop. 

On weeks where we spend lots of time working together, we'll take a 15-minute â˜• break at about the mid-way point. 

Note that some weeks, particularly during `Modules II` and `III`, we may not hold class in person but rather on Zoom. Announcements about this will be made on Slack, where you can also find the Zoom link.
