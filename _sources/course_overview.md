### Overview

This course will be held weekly, and includes a mix of traditional lectures, interactive demonstrations, tutorials, journal clubs, discussion, and project Workshop (“workshop”). Outside of class, you will be expected to meet with your pods (project groups) to implement your experiment, collect data, and complete your analysis and summary reports. 

As the term goes on, we will spend less time on lectures and more time addressing particular questions/issues/tasks you have to deal with in carrying out and analyzing your results. We may choose not to meet in person on some weeks, or to meet only for part of class time. Depending on common preference, groups can arrange to meet with me separately to discuss particular issues, instead of meeting for the whole Projects Workshop slot. Therefore, the schedule for weeks to come is to be taken merely as a guideline unless otherwise stated.

#### When

Every Thursday from Oct. 21, 2021 until February 10th, 2022 at 14:00 - 18:00.

Please note that semester from December 18th, 2021 - January 13th, 2022 and no classes will take place within this time period.

#### COVID

**Class**: The university has announced that teaching this term should be done in person under the 3G Rules. This means that in order to attend class, you must show proof of vaccination, recovery from COVID (only once), or a negative antigen test (for each class). Please get in touch with me if you have any questions or concerns about this. 
We may choose to hold some classes on Zoom throughout the semester, however the format will be largely in-person unless COVID regulations change. 

**Projects**: Experiments with human participants will be done online, while experiments with animal participants will be done in person, unless otherwise noted. 

**Deadlines**: Until we/your hear otherwise, the deadlines are the deadlines. :)


#### Getting Set Up

In this class, we will rely heavily on software designed for statistics and data science, such as R and some Python. We will use only open source and free software. To get you set up for this course, check out this [comprehensive installation instruction](https://avakiai.github.io/expra_winter2021-2022/setup.html) from a fellow EXPRA instructor, Peer Herholz. In a step-by-step manner it will guide you through the installation process, covering several `OS`: `windows`, `macos` and `linux`. 


#### Course Materials
Readings assigned for class (see [Syllabus](https://avakiai.github.io/expra_winter2021-2022/syllabus.html))
Journal articles for journal clubs/your projects (tbd)
[Statistical Rethinking](https://statsthinking21.org/)
[Resources for programming and statistics](https://github.com/avakiai/Scientific-Resources)

#### Assignments

You will be expected to:
* **Read articles/materials** for your project/that are assigned for class (individually)
* Present a research article (**journal club**) related to your project (individually)
* Prepare a **scientific poster** showcasing the results of your experiment (in groups) 
 
However, your grade will come from two written reports, the Demo Report on the subject of the demo experiment we will conduct and analyze together, and the final report: a 15-page written report in the style of a journal article.

| Assignment | Who? | percentage of final grade  | deadline (date, time) |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| demo experiment report | with pod | 40% | Dec. 3, 2021, 11:59 PM CET |
| final report | individually | 60% | Feb. 24, 2022, 11:59 PM CET |
