# Vocal Adaptation Experiment

## Literature

A couple articles to get you started can be found [here](https://avakiai.github.io/expra_winter2021-2022/projects/vocal_adaptation/literature). 

## Stimuli

We'll provide a sample of bat distress calls. What parameters do you think the stimuli should have?, i.e.:

- How many pulses in a "bout"?
- What ISI between pulses?
- What ISI between bouts?

## Methods

* What conditions might best help us answer the question? (E.g. silent recordings, distress bouts, distress bouts with different timings)

* What call parameters would you consider for your analysis?

* How many bats/groups/sessions might be sufficient to test this hypothesis? How long should each condition be?
