# Finalization

`Module III`

In the final stage of a study, we'll generate our results by systematically stepping through our analysis plan, focus on polishing our figures to be maximally effective, revisit our hypothesis and infer some conclusions from our results, and get our study into a form ready for others to consume (whether as a poster, presentation, or written document). We'll also wrap up our study by linking our `analysis` repository and `Pavlovia` repository to our OSF project, and posting a version 
of our report and/or poster to the same.

### Analysis

We'll divide up our analyses into four parts, which we'll tackle and finalize in the few weeks of `Module III`.

#### Analysis I:

Hypothesis 3: Did WM load and explicit information affect liking (rating scores)? 

Method: LM on Z-scores

#### Analysis II:

Hypothesis 3: Did WM load and explicit information affect liking (rating scores)?

Method: LM on aggregate scores/PCA

#### Analysis III:

Hypothesis 1 & 2: Did WM load, explicit information manipulate rates at which people fell for the illusion?

Method: Analyze Open-Text Boxes

#### Analysis IV: Bring it all together

Exploratory Hypotheses: Evaluate role of musical experience in modulating illusion effect.

Method: Aggregate GSI ratings.
