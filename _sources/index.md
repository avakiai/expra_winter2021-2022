This is the course book for EXPRA - Group 6 for the Winter Semester 2021-2022 at Goethe University. 

## About this course

This course is designed to provide you with an introduction to the theory and practice of scientific research. Its primary goals are to:
1. Teach you the basics of designing, conducting, and communicating psychological research according to Open Science principles
2. Give you the opportunity to do hands-on research by realizing a project from start to finish
3. Guide you in learning to use data science to analyze, interpret and present results, and
4. Introduce you to some broader concepts that will serve as essential tools in your scientific toolkit. 
    
In this module, we will cover some experimental methods used in various areas of cognitive psychology as well as “comparative cognition,” i.e. animal cognition research. We will consider the philosophical grounding of these various methodological principles, as well as their implications for “real world” issues. 
 
Moreover, in this module, you will be encouraged to look at science with a wide-angle lens. (The boundaries of departments are entirely made up!) 
 
**Note: In this module, you will have the opportunity to conduct an experiment either with human subjects on a topic within auditory cognition or with animal subjects (the neotropical bat Carollia perspicillata).**

## EXPRA

No matter the scientific field: obtaining a solid understanding of and gaining substantial hands-on experience with research processes and workflows is crucial, with Psychology being no exception to that. Obviously, not everyone will continue in a research setting after their studies but developing a respective skill set will be beneficial independent of what folks might end doing. Critical thinking & evaluation, research project management, quantitative & qualitative analyses, etc. enable a holistic approach to the generation, preservation and dissemination of knowledge, as well as informed decision making. But how should folks learn these things?



Traditionally, one way of achieving this is to familiarize students with all parts of the research process early on in their studies with an application to real-world problems and questions. More precisely, folks conduct several experiments, provided and self-chosen, within which they perform all or most of the necessary steps of the research workflow themselves, both in a guided and independent manner. Importantly, all of this will be conducted based on [open science principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science). This has several important reasons: addressing the faulty direction science and academia in via changing incentive structures ([open methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-notebook_science), [open data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_data), [open access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access),[open peer review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_peer_review)), enable students to become active and self-sufficient parts of the research and scientific community via the sole utilization of [open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) and [open educational resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources), as well as increasing the [diversity and inclusivity of science and academia](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/words-to-action) via the diminution of hurdles and barriers: science by everyone for everyone in an open and welcoming manner.         


As you can see in the `TOC` on the left sidebar, there’s quite a bunch going on here. You may ask: “Oh my, is all of this really necessary?”. Well, it might depend on who you ask but this course and the people being it think so and here’s why: creating a structured and holistic way to empirically train students via a complex framework needs time, effort, details, and dedication. Additionally, to increase openness and sustainability, and thus ultimately the success rate of projects, these things need to be prepared and supplied in a way that is findable, accessible, interoperable and re-usable ([FAIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FAIR_data)) for as many people as possible.
This course is therefore designed to provide only `FAIR` content and materials.

You can use the following sections to navigate through the content of the lecture:

* [Course Overview](https://peerherholz.github.io/EXPRA_Winter2021/overview.html)

   What's this course all about? How are things implemented and supposed to work? 

* [General outline](https://peerherholz.github.io/EXPRA_Winter2021/outline.html)

   What are the specific topics and aspects taught?

* [Course setup](https://peerherholz.github.io/EXPRA_Winter2021/setup.html)

   What do I need to follow and participate in the course?

* [An introduction to the scientific method & theory building](https://peerherholz.github.io/EXPRA_Winter2021/introduction/introduction.html)

   All things gotta start somewhere and working on a research project is no exception to
   that, but how?

* [Experimentation](https://peerherholz.github.io/EXPRA_Winter2021/experimentation/experimentation.html)

   How to set up and conduct experiments to acquire data from participants and subsequently analyze it? 

* [Project finalization](https://peerherholz.github.io/EXPRA_Winter2021/finalization/finalization.html)

   How can you successfully generate insights from your obtained results and communicate those sufficiently?
