## About this course

This course is designed to provide you with an introduction to the theory and practice of scientific research. Its primary goals are to:
1. Teach you the basics of designing, conducting, and communicating psychological research according to Open Science principles
2. Give you the opportunity to do hands-on research by realizing a project from start to finish
3. Guide you in learning to use data science to analyze, interpret and present results, and
4. Introduce you to some broader concepts that will serve as essential tools in your scientific toolkit. 
    
In this module, we will cover some experimental methods used in various areas of cognitive psychology as well as “comparative cognition,” i.e. animal cognition research. We will consider the philosophical grounding of these various methodological principles, as well as their implications for “real world” issues. 
 
Moreover, in this module, you will be encouraged to look at science with a wide-angle lens. (The boundaries of departments are entirely made up!) 
 
**Note: In this module, you will have the opportunity to conduct an experiment either with human subjects on a topic within auditory cognition or with animal subjects (the neotropical bat Carollia perspicillata).**
