# Demo Experiment

We will do a "demonstration experiment" together, that will help you get an overview of the scientific process as you prepare for your own experiments. 

The repository for the demo experiment materials can be found [here](https://github.com/avakiai/yanny-laurel-demo). 

You can use the folder structure of the demo experiment repository to follow along on the analyses. 
I also encourage you to use a similar structure for your term projects. 
You can download the repository as a .zip file by clicking on the `Code` button on the upper right above the repository folder listing.

You can also find the analyses files in this section as an executable (R Markdown) file. (Coming soon.)

Don't worry if some of this jargon sounds strange! We'll go over everything in class. In the meantime, checkout the [GitHub glossary](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary). 
There's plenty of online material to get you familiarized with [Git](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/tutorials/what-is-a-git-repository).

```{admonition} Glossary
:class: tip
**repository**
A repository is the most basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.

```

The experiment itself is coded in PsychoPy/Python, and in a public repository on the [Pavlovia GitLab](https://gitlab.pavlovia.org/akiai/yanny-laurel).
